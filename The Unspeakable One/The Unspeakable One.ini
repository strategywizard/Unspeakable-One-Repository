description.English=This scenario is inspired by The Path to Carcosa Campaign from the Arkham Horror Card Game.\n\nPlayers: 2 - 4\n\nThis scenario features a custom Mythos phase, lots of puzzles, and a challenging ending.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It's meant to be "maddening," so avoid this scenario if you don't want a challenge.\n\nNo evidence is used in this scenario, so discard any Insanity Conditions that involve evidence and draw another one.
